Project Scope: 

This project involves the design and development of a Build-To-Order (BTO) Management System, a centralized platform that enables applicants and HDB staff to view, apply for, and manage BTO projects.

The system supports user authentication via Singpass, user profile management (including age and marital status), password updates, and initialization of user records through file upload. It aims to streamline BTO application and administrative processes within a single integrated system.
